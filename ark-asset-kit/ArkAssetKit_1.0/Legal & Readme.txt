This asset kit was assembled for you to use in creating your own custom Ark presentation.  Do not use these assets in any non-Ark works.  Visual assets are created by Ark.io.  Assets were curated (and in some cases, modified) by ArkStickers.com and ARK_NYC.

This kit may be used for the sole purpose of creating materials for your organization to learn about Ark, or to create materials to spread the word or promote Ark.

To suggest assets to add, contact getarkstickers@gmail.com

Cheers!
